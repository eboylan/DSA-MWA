Folders:
images - for image files

themes - Themeroller files

Files in this folder:

custom.css - custom css file, in addition to styling from themeroller
index.html - Single Page Application, includes script to generate dynamic pages
planets.json - a sample of JSON objects of planets. 
	-(longPlanets.json (test&devFiles folder) file was too large for decent response times)
